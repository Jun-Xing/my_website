<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>So far, I have traveled to 30 countries and more than 120 cities in the world.</li>
<li>My favorite city is London. It is such a wonderful melting pot, blending all kinds of cultures seamlessly, and the Chinese food there is beyond-words delicious. The rain bothers me a little, though, and so does the British humour that I don’t quite comprehend.</li>
<li>I have visited Paris a couple of times but never went to see the cathedral Notre Dame de Paris. The fire last year struck me that some things we thought would always be there for us might disappear in an instant. It was one of the things I regretted the most, not to see the cathedral while I could.</li>
<li>I am very open to new experiences and love to take on challenges.</li>
<li>The first time I went skiing, and it was on a beginner track with a professional coach, I managed to slip and fall on my chin and had a minor concussion. When I fell, everyone cheered and clapped because it was my first fall, and they said there would be many more to come. Despite the pain and dizziness afterwards, the forest view was amazing, and sliding down the hill was so much fun, so I still think it was worth it.</li>
<li>I went for Aurora hunting with friends in Lapland. Before we set off, the guide said that we had a 99% chance to see it that night, but we spent 4 hours at a frozen lake in the middle of the night waiting in minus 24 °C and did not see any trace of an aurora. That incident made me question my luck for quite a while. However, the stars that night were so bright that you can almost see the whole milky way.</li>
<li>I have acrophobia, meaning that high altitudes make my legs shiver. Still, I completed Bungee Jumping twice in my life. For me, the eagerness to conquer fear sometimes tops the fear itself.</li>
<li>I am an amateur photographer. My favorite subjects are people. All kinds of people.</li>
<li>My favorite season is autumn. I wish I could live in a place where it’s autumn all year round.</li>
<li>I am a dog person. I love Shiba Inu dogs, and whenever I see them out on the streets, I will eyeball them until we part ways. In my dream life, there are two Shibas and lots of sunshine in the backyard.</li>
<li>It drives me mad when people ask me if all Chinese eat dogs. I will sit down and explain to them for hours if necessary that it is only a regional culture, and young people hate it. Also, they are running all kinds of campaigns to stop it.</li>
<li>I love watching plays, such as musicals, dramas, and comedies. I once watch an 8-hour play — And Quiet Flows the Don — alone, and it felt like a date with myself. When I am in the theater, I am in a world with no outside noise, and I can just enjoy the show without any distractions.</li>
<li>Music is part of my life. My relentless passion for karaoke often makes me consider singing as a professional career, but my limited talent makes sure that it stays as a hobby.</li>
<li>My favorite pop singer is Ed Sheeran. Apart from having a distinctive voice, he is an authentic and aspirational figure. I once read an interview in which he told the story of how he was bullied as a kid because of his stutter and his ginger hair, and how music gave him the courage to be the unique person and to believe in himself. I watched a clip of him singing at the Montreux Jazz Festival back in 2012 while he was not that famous. The audience did not know who he was, but they fell for his beautiful voice, and they knew someday the whole world would fall for him. It moved me so much and gave me a lot of courage to keep trying in my life as well.</li>
<li>My motivation to learn Erhu, a traditional Chinese musical instrument, originated from a quarrel with a girl I did not get along very well with in the second grade. She let everyone play with her Erhu but me. I asked my Mom to sign me up for Erhu courses immediately after school. Later the girl and I became very close friends until today, and I kept learning and practicing Erhu and passed the highest national professional level exam in high school.</li>
<li>I love coffee so much that I helped a friend open his own coffee shop in my hometown and worked there as a part-time barista every time I went back home.</li>
<li>I’m not too fond of it when my friends and families are on their phones when we hang out. If we are at a restaurant, I would ask everyone to stack their phones on top of each other and take it back when we leave. The first one to take the phone out to use it has to pay for the whole table.</li>
<li>I am a funny person, and I am good at breaking the ice. Therefore, I could easily make friends with strangers.</li>
<li>I like preparing surprises for those I love. Handmade gifts are adorable to me.</li>
<li>The first time I was financially independent happened when I interned at InterContinental Geneva first year in college. I was able to pay for my rent and other living expenses. I even saved some extra money to buy my Mom and Dad gifts. It was the highlight of my adult life.</li>
<li>Despite my love for numbers and my advocacy for reason, I am a very emotional person. I often feel empathetic to others and try my best to accommodate their needs. I cry way above the average frequency of mature adults. But being an empathetic person also means that I find it hard to say no to people, and sometimes it brings me a series of hassle. The good news is I am working on it. I searched online, read books and journals, went to school counseling, and then worked on a few things to “learn the skills to say no”. After a few times, I found it not as hard as I had imagined, and if I did refuse, the world would not collapse, which reassured me a lot.</li>
<li>I once had my head shaved bald when I took part in the “Hair for Hope” charity event to help the Children’s Cancer Foundation raise funds.</li>
<li>I love watching TV series. Three of my favorites are How I Met Your Mother, Orange is The New Black and Fleabag.</li>
<li>My 2020 New Year Resolution is to spend more time with myself and to read more.</li>
<li>My favorite quote comes from the very first episode of Friends: ¨Welcome to the real world. It sucks. You’re gonna love it¨.</li>
